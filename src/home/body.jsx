          People people people, let's get this thing rollin. Today is the day. We are finally done with our exams...The time has come for the <strong>LAD</strong> to focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          l learnt something thrilling today. The level of it's correctness l am yet to evaluate. Here it is... "The things you put less effort in tend to corelate towards you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, let's move on.... 
        </p>
        <p>
          l want to introduce you to a girl named Takudzwa. Yes l know, l been keeping her a secret for a minute now. Well she is ....

          l have no idea what to say .Occassionally l think there are{" "}
          <strong> NO LIMITATIONS</strong> in this world.Then l go on to realise
          there could be limitations only to the extend my mind lets exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an aphorism <i>As a man thinketh so is he.</i> It is
          definitely as biblical as it is manifested in the physical. l believe
          James Allen said it, the bible said it.l have said it. That alone
          should stir up something in you.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          l really wish l had more for you, but for today that is it. Have a
          lovely day. Stay blessed. Like always my friends, today is going to be
          a good day.

        <h1>Today's Blog : Monday 27 November 2023</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Enjoy Your life.</strong> That is the topic for the
          day.Listen, l woke up today feeling like not working out.Full
          disclaimer <i>l worked out........</i>Why?Well l have discovered
          something about the human mind.My mind in particular because l speak
          for none other than myself. The thing that happens with my mind is, it
          tells you something and if you choose to ignore it, it magically shuts
          up.Recently l have been rebelling against it. Doing complementary
          things to what it tells me. <i> Lesson here is,</i>{" "}
          <strong> Just Do It.</strong> Defy the odds. Just go for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          l appreciate you for taking this opportunity to go through my
          mind.Have a blessed day. Like always my friends,{" "}
          <strong>Today is going to be a good da</strong>

          many fxcks. That's stopping.
